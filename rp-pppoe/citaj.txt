Hello, I'm trying to connect to the internet directly over PPPoE. At the moment (to write this message) I use wi-fi router which is already configured by me. I've read arch wiki on pppd package, but after several attempts it didn't succeed.
What I did:

sudo pacman -S pppd rp-pppoe

Added config file at /etc/ppp/peers/letai as it was suggested on wiki:

plugin rp‐pppoe.so 
# rp_pppoe_ac 'your ac name' 
# rp_pppoe_service 'letai'
# eno1 is taken from "ip link"
eno1
name "MYLOGIN" 
usepeerdns 
persist 
defaultroute 
hide‐password 
noauth

Changed one line at /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf:

# Ethernet card connected to DSL modem
ETH=eno1

Added password to chap- and pap-secrets files:

# Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client	server	secret			IP addresses
"MYLOGIN"	*	"MYPASS"

And lastly I tried to start it:

sudo pppd call letai
pppd: In file /etc/ppp/peers/letai: unrecognized option 'plugin rp‐pppoe.so '

sudo pppd
Couldn't open the /dev/ppp device: No such device or address
pppd: Please load the ppp_generic kernel module.

Any suggestions how to solve the problem?
Thank you in advance
